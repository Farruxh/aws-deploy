# AWS Aurora RDS Learning Project

This is a small project I have worked on while learning AWS deployment. The main focus of this project was to understand **Amazon Aurora and RDS**, how to make a database, how to modify, how it works, and how to make it publicly accessible.  

I worked on this project during my **Cloud Computing** course to get hands-on experience with AWS services.
